# Jukebox

## Introduction

You will build a Jukebox app using Javascript. It won't be that impressive at first, but we'll make it better every week. It will work as follows:

- When the user loads Jukebox, it prompts the to enter a song to play.
- Jukebox plays the song the user entered.
- When the song is finished playing, Jukebox prompts the user to enter another song.

Songs will be entered in the following format: `"A B C# D"`. These letters represent the pitch (or frequency) to play. The user can also optionally specify the length of each note (the number of beats) using the following format: `"A*2 B C#*3 D"`. If beats aren't specified, they default to 1.

I've provided you with `player.js` which defines the `playSong` function to play a song composed of an array of note objects. You can use `playSong` as follows:

```js
var notes = [{pitch: 'A', beats: 1}, {pitch: 'C#', beats: 2}, {pitch: 'D', beats: 4}];
// Play the song at 400 beats per minute.
playSong(notes, 400);
```

Your tasks for completing the Jukebox are outlined below.

## Tasks

1. Create a new script file, `jukebox.js`, where you will put all of your Javascript for this assignment.

2. First we need to be able to parse individual notes. Write a function `parseNote` that takes a string representing a single note (e.g. "C#*2") and returns a note object (e.g. {pitch: "C#", beats: 2}). If the user doesn't provide a number of beats (e.g. "C#") then set beats to 1.

```js
// Example usage
parseNote("C#*2"); //=> { pitch: 'C#', beats: 2}
parseNote("D"); //=> { pitch: 'D', beats: 1}
```

3. Now let's parse a whole song string. Write a function `parseSong` that takes a song string as above, and returns an array of note objects. The `parseSong` function should use the `parseNote` function.

```js
// Example usage
parseSong("Ab B"); // => [{pitch: 'Ab', beats: 1}, {pitch: 'B', beats: 1}]
```

4. Finally, let's build our amazing Jukebox! Create an HTML page that, when loaded, prompts the user for a song string and plays the song. To keep things clean, please use two script tags in your page. One to load the provided `player.js` file, and one to load your own `jukebox.js` file.

5. [Bonus] When the song if finished playing, prompt the user for another song, forever! Hint: You can pass an optional 3rd parameter to `playSong`, a function that will get called when the song is finished playing, as shown below.

```js
var onComplete = function () {
  console.log('Song finished playing');
}

playSong(song, bpm, onComplete);
```
